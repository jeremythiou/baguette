# Baguette

Baguette is a website project that contains a little game.

The goal of the game is to spin the baguettes that appear on the screen to display the bakery logo.

At the beginning of the game, you can choose the amount of baguettes to display. Once you hit the start button, you have to click on the baguettes randomly positioned on the screen. When all the baguettes are spinning, the bakery logo appears and you have finished the game.

I will add a time counter and a scoreboard for the amount of baguette the player choose.
